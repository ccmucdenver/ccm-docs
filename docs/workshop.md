# Hands-on Workshop September 21, 2023
*Updated March 2025*

Please see the [Clusters Guide](../clusters_guide/) and other documentation sections on the left for more information.

Contact: Megan Duff and Jan Mandel will be happy to answer any questions!

## Log in
* know your CU Denver username
* open a Terminal (mac or linux), or command/powershell window (windows 10 or 11) 
* type into the window: *ssh your_username@math-alderaan.ucdenver.pvt* (replace *your_username* by your own username, of course)
* Enter your CU Denver password
    
## Check out the command line
* The easiest text editor is *nano*, exit it by *control-x*
* *mkdir* to make a directory, *cd* to change directory. *cd ..* will go to the parent directory.
* *man commandname* to get help about a command. Try *man top*

## Get the templates
* Type *git clone https://github.com/ccmucdenver/templates* 
* Type *cd templates* and *ls* to see what files you have there 

## Submit a batch job
* Look at the file *alderaan_simple.sh*
* Submit it: *sbatch alderaan_simple.sh*
* Look for the output file, it will have name starting with *slurm* 
* Try a GPU job: *sbatch alderaan_single_gpu.sh*  What did it do? Look at the output.

## Using multiple CPUs at the same time
* Multiple cores within a single node - just put the number on the --ntasks or -n line other than 1 when using software that written to use multiple cores automatically, such as R or Matlab.
* Multiple cores on multiple nodes - we have 2048 cores total on the compute nodes! - you need to have a code specifically written for this. Let's build some. Type 
    cd examples
    make
* Look at *alderaan_single.sh* *alderaan_mpi_general.sh* and submit them
* Look at *run_alderaan.slurm* and submit it. What is it doing?

## Singularity containers
* Complete computing environments with custom software and different Linux versions.
* Our containers are in */storage/singularity*. See [Singularity](../singularity/) for what containers we have and more details.
* *alderaan_single_gpu.sh* you used before runs tensorflow in a singularity container. Look at the script how it works!
* *singularity_alderaan_shell.slurm* allows you to run an entire shell script in a singularity container. Try to add another command. Try to use another container.
* **Extra credit:** run the examples from [https://github.com/ResearchComputing/Intro_GPU_Acceleration](https://github.com/ResearchComputing/Intro_GPU_Acceleration).

## Environment Modules
* Another way to set up a custom environment is by modules. Type *module avail* what is there and *man module* for more information.

## Conda
* Use one of the singularity containers with anacoda and make your own conda envirohments.
* Or install your own anaconda or miniconda.

## Interactive jobs
* The easiest is to go to https://math-alderaan.ucdenver.edu. You will get an interactive Jupyter web session on one of the compute nodes (so you do not need to worry about load on the node), 4GB memory, 1 core, with terminal windows, file browser, and Python notebooks.
* Please do not ssh to work on compute nodes, you could interfere with jobs running there which would make you very unpopular. It is OK to ssh to compute nodes to check on your running jobs submitted through sbatch, however.
* The magical incantation *srun -p math-alderaan --time=2:00:0 -n 1 --pty bash -i* will teleport your session to a compute node for two hours with one core reserved for you. Try it! Your interactive job will not interfere with CPU usage of other. Try *matlab -nodesktop*, run something CPU intensive, ssh to the node from another terminal window, and try *top*
* Try a Python, R, or Matlab job!

## Memory
* Our compute nodes have 64 cores and 512GB memory each. This seems like a lot, but you may be sharing it with others. The default memory reserved is 4GB per cpu core. You can reserve more or less by using the *--mem=* flag with memory in MB. For example, *--mem=10240* will request 10GB reservation. If a job tries to use more memory than it has reserved, it may be able to do that a bit, but then it will be killed by OOM (the Out Of Memory daemon). The concept of the "used memory" here is the same as the number shown by `top` under `RES`. It does not include memory allocated by the code but not written to, or swapped out to disk. Use the script `max_mem.sh` to see the current memory reservations on a node.
