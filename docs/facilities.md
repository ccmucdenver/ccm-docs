### Computing Facilities 

The CU Denver Center for Computational Mathematics (CCM) operates HPC cluater [Alderaan cluster](../alderaan/), total 2240 AMD EPYC 7502 cores and 4 NVIDIA A-100 GPUs: 2048 AMD 7502 cores and 16TB memory in 32 compute nodes (64 cores and 512GB per node), each with dual 960GB SSDs; 2 high-memory GPU nodes each with two NVIDIA A100 GPU, 2TB memory, and 64 AMD 7502 cores, and 960GB SSDs; head node with 64 cores and 256GB memory; 816TB storage (1PB raw), HDR100 InfiniBand interconnect, and 10Gb/s connectivity from every node to Internet 2. The cluster was funded by the National Science Foundation and installed in 2021. 

Accounts are available for faculty and students at CU Denver | Anschutz campuses, as well as to sponsored external collaborars with affiliate appointments. Login is by university credentials. 

Faculty and students use workstations in their offices as well as the campus wireless network,

### Software
*   The cluster uses SLURM batch scheduler.
*   Installed software includes MATLAB, R, and GNU compilers. Additional software is installed on request on Alderaan or in Singularity containers for use anywhere.
*   A large collection of software for individual devices is available to CU Denver students and faculty through the Office of Information for free or at reduced costs, including a MATLAB site license.

### Personnel Resources

* The system administrator is Professsor Emeritus Jan Mandel, backed by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences IT, and assisted by student staff. 

### Other Resources

* CU Denver is member of the the [Rocky Mountain Advanced Computing Consortium](https://rmacc.org) (RMACC). The RMACC operates the [Alpine](https://www.colorado.edu/rc/alpine) supercomputer at CU Boulder. Allocations on RMACC resources are available to CU Denver students and faculty. Access to RMACC is through ACCESS federated login (previously XSEDE).
