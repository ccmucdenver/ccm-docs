# Guide to CCM Clusters

## Logging in

### How to log in

The system uses CentOS 7 and 8 operating system. There are two head nodes (entry points) to the system, `math-alderaan.ucdenver.pvt` and `clas-compute.ucdenver.pvt`. You can use either. Alderann cluster runs Centos 8 while the other clusters and `clas-compute` run Centos 7.

At this time, the main way of using the system is to use an SSH client to login to a terminal session on clas-compute or math-alderaan. You will need to be on the CU Denver network (wired or CU Denver wireless, not CU Denver Guest), or using the university's VPN.

This system uses your normal portal/email username and password, but user account must be set up before using the system. Please go to [accounts](./accounts/) to request an account.

On Linux or a Mac, you can use simply the Terminal app, which is built into the operating system. It is hidden away in Applications -> Utilities folder on a Mac and in similar places on various Linux desktops. You may want to drag it to your dock (on a Mac) or the desktop (on Linux) so that it is available more conveniently next time.

On Windows, you will need an SSH client. There are several out there, but generally most people use PuTTY which is available for download [here](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html). You can use either 32 or 64 bit versions - computers that require the 32 bit version are rather rare (early Windows 7/Vista/XP).

You can also use the [Windows 10 subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10), where you install a Linux distribution as an app and can use it to ssh out like from a terminal window like on any Linux machine. This is often more stable than Putty, which tends to get stuck on some computers.

Either way, from a terminal window, at the command line prompt type in:

    ssh username@clas-compute.ucdenver.pvt
    
or

    ssh username@math-alderaan.ucdenver.pvt

After connecting, it should ask for your CU Denver password and you enter it at this point. You should be then at the `clas-compute` prompt or `math-alderaan` prompt and in your home directory. 

### Interactive use

Using a server ???interactively??? (aka not scheduling a job) is often needed for troubleshooting a job or just watching what it is doing in real time. After SSH???ing into a head node, you can type <code>ssh math-colibri-i01</code> or whatever server you want to go to directly. 

**Please do not run anything directly on compute nodes, which are reserved for jobs under the control of the scheduler, even if you may be able to ssh there.  These are nodes with names like math-colibri-c01 with something else than "i" before the number. Using compute nodes, where other people run jobs through the scheduler, will interfere with their work and make you very unpopular.** It is OK to ssh to a compute node to check on your job, but  don't run anything there.


### Screen virtual terminal

If you use `screen`, if you get disconnected, whatever you were running is still going and you can connect to it later. This is called a virtual terminal session. It is generally a good idea to use `screen` on math-compute, math-alderaan, or on the interactive nodes.  

Typing `screen` creates a new terminal session. You can give it a name you want to juggle more sessions, by `screen -S 'name'`  (make the name whatever you want). 

If you want to disconnect from the session but leave it running, hit the combination of Control-A and press the D key to disconnect. Control-A is the combo to let screen know you want to do an action.

When you want to reconnect to your screen session later, log back onto wherever you started the screen and type <code>screen ???r</code>. If you have more than one screen, it???ll complain and tell you the screens you have available to reconnect to. Type <code>screen ???r 'name???</code> to reconnect to that screen. 
 
You can't just scroll in `screen` to see your terminal history as you normally would.
Press Control-A and then Esc and scrolling up and down will work temporarily the usual way. When you type anything, `screen` will leave the scrolling model.

## File Storage

**You are responsible for keeping copies of your important files elsewhere. Files and entire filesystems can be lost.** 

The home directories are on a shared file server and linked as `/home/username`. Everyone can have also 
a project directory `/storage/department/projects/username` 
(where department may be one of many departments who use this system).
The difference is that home directories are backed up occasionally 
while project directories are not. Please keep your home directory small to make the backups possible.

In addition, groups can have shared project directories also in `/storage/department/projects`.

If you need a lot of data storage, please contact us before filling everything you can find.

On Alderaan only, you can make your own directory in `/scratch`, which is on a large fast filesystem.
When `/scratch` starts filling up, oldest files will be purged automatically. 

**Do not keep any confidential or sensitive files on this system.** We are not equipped for the level of security this would take. 
In particular, no proprietary data, health records, grades, social security numbers, and like are allowed. 
If you use ssh keys to connect elsewhere from this system 
(such as github or another computer account), it is highly recommended to make an ssh key with a passcode for that. Otherwise,
 the security of the account you are connecting to is only as good as the read protection of your files here.

Files and directories including your home directory are created with permissions which allow anyone to read them but not 
write. This is Linux default to encourage collaboration. If you want to keep a file or directory private, you need to change the permissions yourself. 
Type <code>chmod og-rwx file_or_directory_name</code> to make the file or directory not accessible by others (except system administrators, of course).


<!---
`df ???h` will show you the storage arrays and how much space is available. There are different types of "empty" space in linux so it may say there is plenty of space in `df ???h` yet the array is full.

     math-score-c05         1        math-score idle  



It looks confusing but there is a method to the madness in the naming convention. Obviously, math-colibri and math-score are the identifiers for what cluster/building the servers are in, but the ???c## and ???i## stand for compute and interactive. The c## servers are usually part of the queuing system and the i## ones are for interactive use. Again, never ssh to compute nodes directly.

## Submitting Jobs to the Scheduler

### Submitting a job

The <code>sbatch job_script</code> command is used to submit a job into a queue. Your job starts executing in the directory where it was submitted, so submit it from a directory accessible to all compute nodes, such as a subdirectory of your home directory. You can add switches to the <code>sbatch</code> command, but it is recommended to make them a part of your batch script so that you do not have to do that every time. Please do not use more cores than the number of tasks specified in your script.

### Template batch job scripts

The templates batch scripts and simple examples to run are in <code>/storage/templates</code>. You can copy the scripts from there, or git clone your own from [https://github.com/ccmucdenver/templates.git](https://github.com/ccmucdenver/templates.git) and build also the examples: Type <code>make</code> in the <code>examples</code> directory. 

#### Single-core job

This script will be sufficient for many jobs, such as those you code yourself which do not use multiprocessing.

     #!/bin/bash
     # A simple single core job template
     #SBATCH --job-name=mpi_hello_single
     #SBATCH --partition=math-alderaan
     #SBATCH --time=1:00:00                    # Max wall-clock time
     #SBATCH --ntasks=1                        # number of cores, leave at 1
     examples/hello_world_fortran.exe          # replace by your own executable
     
If you run an application that can use more cores, you can requests the number of cores in <code>--ntask</code> parameter instead of 1. Your allocation will be charged for the time of all cores, regardless if you use them or not.

If you expect that your application will use more memory than 8GB (our nodes have 512GB memory and 64 cores each), you should request more tasks, about the expected memory usage in GB divided by 8. Otherwise the node memory may get overloaded when the machine gets busy with many jobs, and everyone's jobs may stall or crash. Note: this may change once we start allocating memory use, but at the moment we do not.
 
#### A simple MPI job template

     #!/bin/bash
     # alderaan_mpi.sh
     # A simple MPI job template
     #SBATCH --job-name=mpi_hello
     #SBATCH --partition=math-alderaan
     #SBATCH --time=1:00:00                    # Max wall-clock time
     #SBATCH --ntasks=360                      # Total number of MPI processes, no need for --nodes
     mpirun examples/mpi_hello_world.exe       # replace by your own executable, no need for -np

#### A more general MPI job template

You can request the number of nodes. The scheduler will then split the tasks over the nodes.

     #!/bin/bash
     # alderaan_mpi_general.sh
     # A a more general MPI job template
     #SBATCH --job-name=mpi_hello
     #SBATCH --partition=math-alderaan    
     #SBATCH --nodes=2                   # Number of requested nodes
     #SBATCH --time=1:00:00              # Max wall-clock time
     #SBATCH --ntasks=5                  # Total number of tasks over all nodes, max 64*nodes
     mpirun -np 10 examples/mpi_hello_world.exe # replace by your own executable and number of processors
     # do not use more MPI processes than nodes*ntasks
     
## Interactive jobs through the scheduler

Remember you should not directly ssh to a node to run your job. For interactive access to a compute node, do instead

```
srun -p math-alderaan --time=2:00:0 -N 1 -n 1 --pty bash -i
```
This will request a session for you as a job in a single core slot on a compute node in the math-alderaan partition for up to 2 hours. After the job starts, your session is transfered to the node. The job will end when you exit or the time runs out.

## Viewing Job Queues and Job Status

The <code>squeue</code> command is used to gather information from the scheduler. Just <code>squeue</code> will show one line for each
job running on the system.

## Custom application software

Additional software can be installed as modules. Software in a module is on the system all the time, "loading" a module just changes your environment to make it available to you. Software modules need to be compatible with the operating system, and the modules on our different clusers are generally different. See [modules](../modules) for more information.

We also use Singularity containters, which provide a complete enviroment, avoid software conflicts, and can execute anywhere on the clusters. The disadvantage, however, is that you can use the system software installed in the container; the system you are on is not visible inside a container
.
Using singularity is easy. Type, for example, 

    singularity shell /storage/singularity/tensorflow
    python3
    
and you can use many Python packages for machine learning. We have containers with statistics software, optimization, molecular chemistry, optimization,
and more. See [Singularity](../singularity/) for more details. 

**We will be happy to install software and build containers for you, do not hesitate to ask!**
